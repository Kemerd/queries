# queries

Friend sent me this from one of his Java certification courses. Thought it was interesting, decided to code it up in C++. Experiment with STD.

You are given q queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:

- 1,x : Insert x into your data structure,
- 2,y : Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
- 3,z : Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly z. If yes, print 1 else 0.

The queries are given in the form of the 2-D array queries the size q where queries[i][0] contains the operation,
and queries[i][1] contains the data element.
